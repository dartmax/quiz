# ðŸ’« React QUIZ

```
- React 
- SCSS
```

## What's inside?
    .
    â”œâ”€â”€ src
    â”œâ”€â”€ yarn.lock
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json

1.  **`/src`**: All code that will be used in the frontend when the website is build.
2.  **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(Never change this file directly).**
3.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the projectâ€™s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.
